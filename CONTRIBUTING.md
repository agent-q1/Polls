# Contributing Guidelines

We're a pretty small team so we don't really need this, but might as well list some good practices.

- Always work in topic branches
- Small commits (`git add -p` + `git commit -v` is your friend :)) 
- Sensible commit comments
- Never rebase after you have pushed something
- Conventional Commits
