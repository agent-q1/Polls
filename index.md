## Welcome to Polls

This is a fun little project that me and my roommate took up where we try and make polls be the next big thing.

### Features
We've got the basic functionality down.
- There's authentication
- There's polls (albeit not extremely beautiful)
- There's sockets to view real time results
- And a recommender system that we absolutely did not rip off of Netflix

### We love more people
Amidst TA202 and a huge flurry of assignments, we feel like this project might be stagnating. Hence we'd love to have you on board! Regardless of whether you're a designer, artist or even a wordpress developer.
